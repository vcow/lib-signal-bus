# Signal bus
This is the multithread signal bus for Unity that lets you dispatch strongly typed messages safely across threads and scene scopes. Create a shared `SignalBus`, subscribe to the signals you need with `Subscribe<T>(Action<T>)`, and call `Fire(signal)` (or `Fire<T>()`) to notify every subscriber, including listeners attached to child buses created via `CreateSubBus()`.  
<br/>Use it to decouple systems, keep gameplay logic thread-friendly, and still control the lifetime of subscriptions by disposing a bus (or any of its sub-buses) when a scope ends.

<br/>**CommandExtension.** Commands are signals that must be handled exactly once. The extension enforces this contract: `SubscribeCommand<T>()` guarantees there is only one listener, and `FireCommand(command)` throws if the command has zero or several subscribers. This makes commands a safe fit for requestâ€“response style interactions where a single handler is required.

<br/>**R3 Observable extension.** The R3 integration wraps `SignalBus` subscriptions into an `Observable<T>` so you can manage signal listeners as `IDisposable`. Call `ObserveSignal<T>()` to bridge the bus with reactive pipelines and dispose the subscription alongside any other reactive resources.
